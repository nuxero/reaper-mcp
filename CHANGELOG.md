# Changelog

All notable changes to TwelveTake REAPER MCP are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.1] - 2026-06-09

Infrastructure release — no tool contract changes.

### Added
- Mocked pytest suite (`tests/`) that exercises tools without REAPER running.
- GitHub Actions CI (ruff + pytest on Python 3.10–3.13).
- `dev` optional-dependency group and `ruff` configuration in `pyproject.toml`.

### Changed
- Rewrote `test_connection.py` to test the **file bridge** (the supported path) instead
  of the deprecated HTTP server. Now pure standard library — no `httpx` needed to smoke-test.
- Documented the file-based Lua bridge as the only supported communication path.

### Deprecated
- HTTP bridges (`reaper_web_server.lua` / `reaper_web_server.py`). Kept for existing users
  but no longer maintained; they will not receive new tools and may be removed in v2.0.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- FX parameter automation tools (5): `get_fx_envelope`, `get_fx_envelope_points`,
  `add_fx_envelope_point`, `delete_fx_envelope_point`, `clear_fx_envelope` — read and write
  automation envelopes for individual FX parameters.
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` for contributors.

### Changed
- Updated `reaper_mcp_bridge.lua` with handlers for the new FX envelope tools.
- Hardened `.gitignore` (ignores `.claude/` and local tooling artifacts).

Total tools: **135**.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-14

### Added
- `get_project_summary()` — one-call overview of project state (tracks, tempo, markers, length).
- GitHub sponsorship links (Buy Me a Coffee, Ko-fi).
- README "highlights" section.

Total tools: **130**.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-12

### Added
- Initial public release: **129 MCP tools** for controlling REAPER DAW.
- Track operations, FX control, routing/sidechain, transport, project management,
  MIDI composition, audio item editing, markers/regions, automation, selection/editing,
  and mixing/mastering helpers.
- File-based communication bridge (default) plus optional HTTP mode
  (Lua and Python in-REAPER servers).
